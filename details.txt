Create a complete React Native Expo app called "PlastiSort AI" - a plastic waste sorting and recycling impact tracker.

CORE CONCEPT:
Users scan plastic items with their camera, AI identifies the plastic type, tells them which recycling bin to use, and tracks their environmental impact with gamification.

AUTHENTICATION & USER FLOW:
- Welcome screen with app logo and tagline
- Option to "Continue as Guest", "Sign in with Google", or "Sign in with Email"
- Guest users can browse and use core features but prompted to sign up to save progress
- Allow guests to convert to full account anytime without losing data
- Email/password registration with email verification
- Google OAuth integration
- Profile setup after signup (name, school/organization selection, avatar upload)
- Forgot password flow with email reset

HOME SCREEN:
- Top header with user avatar, greeting, and notification bell
- Quick stats cards showing: Total Items Scanned, CO2 Saved, Current Streak, World Rank
- Animated tree visualization that grows taller as user earns more impact points (use Lottie or custom SVG animation)
- Tree starts as small sprout at 0 points, becomes full tree at 1000+ points
- Quick action button: "Scan Plastic Now" (large, prominent, green)
- Recent activity feed showing last 5 scans with plastic type and timestamp
- Weekly challenge card: "Sort 20 items this week - 45% complete"
- Bottom tab navigation: Home, Scan, Impact, Leaderboard, Profile

CAMERA/SCAN SCREEN:
- Full-screen camera viewfinder with overlay guides
- Flashlight toggle button
- Gallery upload button to scan from photos
- Big circular "Capture" button
- Instructions overlay: "Point camera at plastic item's recycling symbol"
- After capture, show loading state with "Analyzing plastic..." animation
- Results screen displays:
  * Large plastic type icon and name (PET, HDPE, PP, LDPE, PVC, PS, OTHER)
  * Confidence percentage with color-coded badge (green >80%, yellow 60-80%, red <60%)
  * Recycling bin color indicator (large colored circle: GREEN for recyclable, RED for non-recyclable, YELLOW for needs cleaning)
  * Clear instruction text: "Place in GREEN bin" with icon
  * Educational section: "Why this matters" with brief fact about this plastic type
  * Environmental stats: "Recycling this saves X grams of CO2"
  * Action buttons: "Log This Item" (saves to history), "Scan Another", "Learn More"
- If confidence is low (<60%), show "Unsure? Try different angle" with rescan option
- Haptic feedback on successful scan

IMPACT DASHBOARD:
- Hero section with large animated number showing total impact points
- Breakdown cards with icons:
  * Total items scanned (with trend: +12 this week)
  * Total weight sorted (estimated based on item types)
  * CO2 saved (in kg, with tree equivalent: "Equal to 5 trees")
  * Plastic waste prevented from ocean (in kg)
- Interactive pie chart showing plastic types distribution (PET 45%, HDPE 30%, etc.)
- Timeline/calendar view showing daily scanning activity (GitHub-style contribution graph)
- Impact milestones with progress bars:
  * Beginner (0-50 items) ✓ Complete

- Abstract other API calls: leaderboard fetch, user stats, achievement unlocks

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
- React Native's FlatList for long lists (leaderboard, history)

- Validate email format on signup
- Password strength indicator
- Username uniqueness check
- Handle expired sessions with auto-redirect to login
- Rate limiting on API calls (show "please wait" if too many requests)

- Handle very long usernames/school names with text truncation

TESTING DATA SETUP:
- Create real Firebase project with test data
- Seed with 20-30 test users for leaderboard
- Seed with achievement definitions
- Seed with school data
- Create sample scans for demo account

CROSS-PLATFORM CONSIDERATIONS:
- Use Expo's platform-specific code where needed (Platform.OS)
- Test camera on iOS and Android separately
- Ensure Google Sign-In works on iOS, Android, and web
- Web-specific: responsive breakpoints for desktop view
- Web-specific: proper meta tags and SEO
- Use Expo's splash screen and app icon configuration

BUILD & DEPLOYMENT READY:
- Configured for EAS Build (Expo Application Services)
- App.json with proper metadata: name, slug, version, icons, splash screen
- Bundle identifier and package name set
- Google OAuth client IDs for iOS, Android, and web configured
- Firebase config files for each platform
- Privacy descriptions for camera and photo library access (iOS Info.plist)

The app should feel premium, smooth, and encouraging. Every interaction should make users feel proud of their environmental contribution. Make scanning plastic feel like a game, not a chore. Use encouraging copy throughout: "Amazing work!", "You're making a difference!", "Keep the streak alive!". The app should work flawlessly on iOS, Android, and web with consistent experience across all platforms.
